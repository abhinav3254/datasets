But Sarah is not building for herself, for her niece (Sarah Snook) or for the brilliant Doctor Eric Price (Jason Clarke) whom she has summoned to the house. She is building a prison, an asylum for hundreds of vengeful ghosts, and the most terrifying among them have a score to settle with the Winchesters.','["Helen Mirren","Sarah Snook","Finn Scicluna-O''Prey"]','5.3','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2OWE5OGItMTE4Yi00ZmIzLThjZDctNTU1OTMxMTc3Yjg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4NTM5NDY@._V1_SY500_CR0,0,315,500_AL_.jpg'),

Later, Washington Post owner, Kay Graham, is still adjusting to taking over her late husband''s business when editor Ben Bradlee discovers the New York Times has scooped them with an explosive expose on those papers. Determined to compete, Post reporters find Ellsberg himself and a complete copy of those papers. However, the Post''s plans to publish their findings are put in jeopardy with a Federal restraining order that could get them all indicted for Contempt. Now, Kay Graham must decide whether to back down for the safety of her paper or publish and fight for the Freedom of the Press. In doing so, Graham and her staff join a fight that would have America''s democratic ideals in the balance.                Written by
